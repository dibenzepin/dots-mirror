# getting started

The steps you'll need to take to use this flake depend on whether you're installing this on macOS, NixOS, or a generic Linux distribution. Regardless, they all revolve around the following:

- Install Nix;
- Clone the repo;
- Rebuild/switch into the new configuration.

I'll document these[^1], but assuming:
- you have a boot medium with NixOS loaded up on it and want to provision a new computer, check [here](./01-nixos.md),
- you've gotten your hands on a Mac, read [here](./02-mac.md).
